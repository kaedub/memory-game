# Memory

#### Bugs and Issues
1. GIF files are too large and cause a delay in the game, especially with slow connection  
  * *Solutions include using images instead of gifs, or greaty reducing the file size of the gifs*  
2. Game grid is not responsive or mobile friendly 
  * *Only solution is to rebuild grid using. I will likely use Bootstrap grids to handle this.*
